# YouTube-data-analysis-by-Apache-PIG
YouTube has huge impact on us as a asocial media. In this project YouTube data has been imported and analysed through multiple problem statements to get important insights of the data.
One can get YouTube data free of cost from internet and make use of this project for analysis.
Hadoop with cluster of multiple nodes with Apache PIG installed is the pre-requisite of this project. Even single node installation is also work fine.
Design of different problem statements for analysis are on the basis of owner's interest and can be extended as per requirements.
Run time of execution can vary according to the size of cluster one uses.
Small chunk of actual data has been imported here for analysis whereas actual size of data is way more in size.
Before loading the data in Apache-PIG, it is essential to have it in cleaned way(csc,tsv etc.). Cleaning process is one's choice altogether. I have cleansed it using python.
