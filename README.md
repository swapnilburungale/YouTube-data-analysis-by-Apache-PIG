YouTube has huge impact on us as a asocial media. In this project YouTube data has been imported and analysed through multiple problem statements to get important insights of the data.
One can get YouTube data free of cost from internet and make use of this project for analysis.
Hadoop with cluster of multiple nodes (single node installaion is also fine) with Apache PIG installed is the pre-requisite of this project.
Design of different problem statements for analysis are on the basis of owner's interest and can be extended as per requirements.
Run time of execution can vary according to the size of cluster one uses.
